# Curtain Scroll Effect Implementation with Framer Motion

## Current Status
- ✅ Analyzed requirements and dependencies
- ✅ Confirmed Framer Motion and GSAP are installed
- ✅ Got user approval for implementation plan

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Rewrite CurtainScroll.jsx using Framer Motion
- [ ] Implement useScroll hook for scroll-based animation
- [ ] Add clipPath animation for curtain reveal effect
- [ ] Add physics-based spring animations
- [ ] Implement cloth-like wave effects
- [ ] Keep curtain rod and progress indicator
- [ ] Add floating particles with animation
- [ ] Test animation performance and smoothness
- [ ] Adjust timing and easing as needed

## Key Features to Implement
- Scroll-triggered animation using useScroll hook
- clipPath: 'inset(0% 0% 0% 0%)' to 'inset(100% 0% 0% 0%)' transition
- Physics-based spring animations for natural movement
- Subtle wave effects for cloth-like behavior
- Maintain existing UI elements (rod, progress, particles)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Animation triggers correctly on scroll
- [ ] Smooth 60fps performance
- [ ] Curtain effect feels natural and cloth-like
- [ ] Progress indicator updates correctly
- [ ] Floating particles animate smoothly
- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes
