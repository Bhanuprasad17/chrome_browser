# TODO - Add and Unify Animations Across Website Components

## Steps:

1. Add entrance animations to `DownloadPage.jsx`
   - Use Framer Motion for main elements (logo, headline, buttons, links)
   - Use `AnimatedText` component for headline text animation

2. Review and unify animations in existing components:
   - `Hero.jsx`: Ensure GSAP animations are consistent in timing and easing
   - `Header.jsx`: Review GSAP timeline for consistency
   - `Features.jsx`: Review Framer Motion variants and timing
   - `TabManagement.jsx`: Review Framer Motion variants and hover animations

3. Update styles if needed in corresponding `.module.scss` files for animation effects

4. Test the website locally for smoothness and performance of animations

5. Get user feedback and make adjustments if necessary

This plan will enhance the visual appeal and user experience by adding and unifying animations across the site.
